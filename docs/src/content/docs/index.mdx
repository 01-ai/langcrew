## Quick Start Example

**Build your first agent crew in under 5 minutes:**

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Crew, Task
from langcrew.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from langcrew_tools import WebSearchTool

@CrewBase
class ResearchCrew:
    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            role="Market Researcher",
            goal="Find latest trends in AI automation",
            tools=[WebSearchTool()],
            backstory="Expert at finding market insights"
        )
    
    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            description="Research AI automation trends for {topic}",
            agent=self.researcher(),
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis report"
        )
    
    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            memory=True,  # Enable memory
            verbose=True  # See execution details
        )

# Run the crew
result = ResearchCrew().crew().kickoff(
    inputs={"topic": "enterprise AI adoption"}
)
```
