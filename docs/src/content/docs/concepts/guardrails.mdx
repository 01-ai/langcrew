description: Understanding guardrails - the safety and validation system in langcrew
---

Guardrails are a safety and validation system in langcrew that ensures data quality, security, and compliance. They act as protective barriers that validate inputs before processing and outputs before delivery.

## What are Guardrails?

Guardrails are validation functions that can be applied to:

- **Inputs**: Validate incoming data before processing
- **Outputs**: Validate generated content before delivery
- **Agents**: Apply global validation rules to all agent operations
- **Tasks**: Apply specific validation rules to individual tasks

Think of guardrails as quality control checkpoints that ensure your AI system operates safely and within defined boundaries.

## Core Concepts

### Input vs Output Guardrails

**Input Guardrails** validate data before it reaches your AI agents:

- Detect sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII)
- Validate data formats and structures
- Check user permissions and access rights
- Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Output Guardrails** validate content after AI processing:

- Ensure content meets quality standards
- Filter inappropriate or harmful content
- Validate output format and structure
- Check for factual accuracy and balanced language

### Multi-Layer Protection

Guardrails can be applied at multiple levels:

- **Agent-Level**: Apply to all tasks executed by an agent
- **Task-Level**: Apply only to specific tasks
- **Combined**: Layer multiple guardrail types for comprehensive protection

## Basic Structure

Every guardrail function follows a simple pattern:

```python
@input_guard  # or @output_guard
def my_guardrail(data: Any) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Args:
        data: The data to validate
        
    Returns:
        Tuple[bool, str]: (is_valid, message)
    """
    # Validation logic here
    if validation_passes:
        return True, "✅ Validation passed"
    else:
        return False, "❌ Validation failed: reason"
```

## Key Components

### Decorators

- `@input_guard`: Marks functions as input validators
- `@output_guard`: Marks functions as output validators

### Error Handling

When guardrails fail, they raise `GuardrailError` exceptions with detailed information about what went wrong.

### Integration Points

Guardrails integrate seamlessly with:

- **Agents**: Apply via `input_guards` and `output_guards` parameters
- **Tasks**: Apply specific guardrails to individual tasks
- **Crews**: Inherit guardrails from their agents and tasks

## Benefits

- **Safety**: Prevent processing of sensitive or harmful data
- **Quality**: Ensure outputs meet your standards
- **Compliance**: Enforce business rules and regulations
- **Reliability**: Catch errors early in the processing pipeline
- **Flexibility**: Mix and match guardrails for different use cases

## Use Cases

- **Content Generation**: Validate AI-generated content quality
- **Data Processing**: Ensure input data meets requirements
- **Security**: Prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **Compliance**: Enforce industry-specific regulations
- **Quality Control**: Maintain consistent output standards
