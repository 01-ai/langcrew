description: Understanding crews - orchestrating multiple agents to work together
---

Crews are the orchestration layer in langcrew that brings agents and tasks together. Built on LangGraph, they manage complex workflows with intelligent routing, memory systems, and dynamic execution patterns.

## Quick Start - Create a Crew

Get your first crew running in just 3 lines:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Task, Crew

agents = [Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather data"), Agent(role="Writer", goal="Create content")]
tasks = [Task(agent=agents[0], description="Research AI trends"), Task(agent=agents[1], description="Write report")]
crew = Crew(agents=agents, tasks=tasks)
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## What is a Crew?

A Crew in langcrew represents an intelligent orchestration system with:

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents working together seamlessly
- **Workflow Management**: Automatic task sequencing and dependency resolution
- **Context Flow**: Information flows between agents and tasks automatically
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent memory across conversations and sessions
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent handoffs between agents and tasks
- **Human Integration**: Built-in human-in-the-loop capabilities

## Core Architecture

Crews orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents with intelligent coordination:

### Design Philosophy

LangCrew crews follow three orchestration principles:

**1. Intelligent Coordination**
- Automatic task sequencing based on dependencies
- Dynamic agent selection and routing
- Context-aware information flow

**2. Stateful Execution** 
- Memory persistence across sessions
- Context accumulation and sharing
- Conversation continuity

**3. Human-AI Collaboration**
- Seamless human oversight integration
- Approval workflows and interventions
- Interactive decision making

## Crew Patterns

### Sequential Workflow

Agents and tasks execute in dependency order:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create workflow
researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather information")
analyst = Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Analyze data")
writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Create reports")

research_task = Task(agent=researcher, description="Research market trends", name="research")
analysis_task = Task(agent=analyst, description="Analyze findings", context=[research_task], name="analysis")
report_task = Task(agent=writer, description="Write final report", context=[analysis_task], name="report")

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, report_task]
)
```

### Agent-Driven Workflow

When no tasks are specified, agents work sequentially:

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer]  # No tasks - agents process input in sequence
)

# Each agent processes the user input in order
result = crew.kickoff({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Analyze market trends")]})
```

### Dynamic Handoffs

Agents can transfer control to specialists:

```python
# Configure agent handoffs
coordinator = Agent(
    role="Coordinator",
    goal="Route work to specialists",
    handoff_to=["specialist", "reviewer"],  # Can transfer to these agents
    is_entry=True,  # Entry point for workflow
    name="coordinator"
)

specialist = Agent(role="Domain Specialist", name="specialist")
reviewer = Agent(role="Quality Reviewer", name="reviewer")

crew = Crew(agents=[coordinator, specialist, reviewer])
```

## Core Capabilities

### Memory Systems

Crews maintain persistent memory across conversations:

```python
# Enable basic memory
crew = Crew(
    agents=[assistant],
    tasks=[support_task],
    memory=True
)

# Memory persists across sessions
result1 = crew.kickoff(thread_id="conversation_1")
result2 = crew.kickoff(thread_id="conversation_1")  # Remembers previous context
```

### Human-in-the-Loop

Enable human oversight when needed:

```python
from langcrew.hitl import HITLConfig

crew = Crew(
    agents=[decision_agent],
    tasks=[critical_task],
    hitl=HITLConfig(enabled=True)  # Human approval required
)
```

### Context Management

Automatic context flow between agents and tasks:

```python
# Context flows automatically through dependencies
tasks = [
    Task(agent=collector, description="Collect data", name="collect"),
    Task(agent=processor, description="Process data", context=["collect"], name="process"),
    Task(agent=reporter, description="Generate report", context=["process"], name="report")
]

crew = Crew(agents=[collector, processor, reporter], tasks=tasks)
```

## When to Use Crews

Crews are ideal for:

- **Multi-Step Workflows** - Complex processes requiring multiple agents
- **Collaborative Tasks** - Work that benefits from different expertise
- **Stateful Conversations** - Applications needing memory and context
- **Quality-Controlled Processes** - Workflows requiring review and approval
- **Dynamic Routing** - Processes where work flow depends on content
- **Human-AI Collaboration** - Applications requiring human oversight

## Execution Modes

### Basic Execution
```python
# Simple execution
result = crew.kickoff()

# With inputs
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI trends", "deadline": "2024-12-31"})
```

### Thread Management
```python
# Persistent conversations
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={"query": "Analyze this data"},
    thread_id="project_123"  # Maintains conversation history
)
```

### Streaming Execution
```python
# Stream crew execution for real-time monitoring
for chunk in crew.stream(input={"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Process request")]}):
    print(f"Step: {chunk}")
```

## Integration Patterns

### Research Pipeline
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather data"),
        Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Analyze findings"), 
        Agent(role="Writer", goal="Create reports")
    ],
    tasks=[
        Task(agent=researcher, description="Research topic", name="research"),
        Task(agent=analyst, description="Analyze data", context=["research"], name="analyze"),
        Task(agent=writer, description="Write report", context=["analyze"], name="report")
    ]
)
```

### Review Workflow
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        Agent(role="Author", goal="Create content"),
        Agent(role="Reviewer", goal="Review quality"),
        Agent(role="Approver", goal="Final approval")
    ],
    tasks=[
        Task(agent=author, description="Create draft", name="draft"),
        Task(agent=reviewer, description="Review content", context=["draft"], name="review"),
        Task(agent=approver, description="Final approval", context=["review"], name="approve")
    ]
)
```
