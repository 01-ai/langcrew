description: Understanding tasks - the work units that agents execute in langcrew
---

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in langcrew. They define what needs to be done, who should do it, how results should be structured, and how work flows between agents in a crew.

## Quick Start - Create a Task

Get your first task running in just 3 lines:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(role="Assistant", goal="Help users", backstory="Helpful AI")
task = Task(agent=agent, description="Analyze data", expected_output="Analysis report")
result = task.invoke({"messages": []})
```

## What is a Task?

A Task in langcrew represents a discrete unit of work with:

- **Clear Definition**: Specific description of what needs to be accomplished
- **Agent Assignment**: The agent responsible for executing the work
- **Expected Output**: Well-defined expectations for the result
- **Context Awareness**: Ability to use outputs from previous tasks
- **Quality Control**: Built-in guardrails and validation
- **Flow Control**: Handoff capabilities to other tasks or agents

## Core Architecture

Tasks are built on the Runnable interface and integrate seamlessly with LangGraph's execution system:

### Design Philosophy

LangCrew tasks follow three core principles:

**1. Explicit Workflow Design**
- Clear task descriptions and expected outputs
- Explicit dependencies between tasks
- Predictable execution flows

**2. Contextual Intelligence**
- Tasks can access outputs from previous tasks
- Automatic context management and passing
- Smart dependency resolution

**3. Quality Assurance**
- Built-in input/output validation
- Structured output schemas
- Guardrails for safety and compliance

## Task Types

### Basic Tasks

Simple, self-contained work units:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Task

task = Task(
    agent=Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Analyze data", backstory="Expert analyst"),
    description="Analyze Q3 sales performance and identify trends",
    expected_output="Sales analysis report with key insights"
)
```

### Sequential Tasks

Tasks that depend on previous work:

```python
# First task
research_task = Task(
    agent=researcher,
    description="Research competitor pricing strategies",
    expected_output="Competitor pricing analysis",
    name="research"
)

# Second task uses first task's output
strategy_task = Task(
    agent=strategist,
    description="Develop pricing strategy based on research",
    expected_output="Pricing strategy recommendations",
    context=[research_task]  # Uses research_task output
)
```

### Structured Output Tasks

Tasks that enforce specific output formats:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Insight(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    impact: str

class AnalysisReport(BaseModel):
    insights: List[Insight]
    summary: str

task = Task(
    agent=analyst,
    description="Analyze customer feedback",
    expected_output="Structured analysis with insights",
    output_json=AnalysisReport  # Enforces this schema
)
```

## Core Capabilities

### Context Dependencies

Tasks automatically receive and process outputs from previous tasks:

```python
# Chain of dependent tasks
tasks = [
    Task(agent=collector, description="Collect data", name="collect"),
    Task(agent=processor, description="Process data", context=["collect"], name="process"),
    Task(agent=reporter, description="Generate report", context=["process"], name="report")
]
```

### Quality Control

Built-in validation and guardrails:

```python
from langcrew.guardrail import input_guard, output_guard

@input_guard
def validate_input(data):
    # Validate incoming data
    return True, "Input valid"

@output_guard  
def validate_output(data):
    # Ensure output quality
    return True, "Output approved"

task = Task(
    agent=processor,
    description="Process sensitive data",
    expected_output="Processed results",
    input_guards=[validate_input],
    output_guards=[validate_output]
)
```

### Task Handoffs

Tasks can delegate work to specialized agents:

```python
primary_task = Task(
    agent=coordinator,
    description="Coordinate project workflow",
    expected_output="Coordination results",
    handoff_to=["specialist_task", "reviewer_task"]  # Can delegate to these
)
```

## When to Use Tasks

Tasks are ideal for:

- **Structured Workflows** - Multi-step processes with clear dependencies
- **Quality-Controlled Work** - Processes requiring validation and compliance
- **Collaborative Processes** - Work that flows between multiple agents
- **Data Processing Pipelines** - Sequential data transformation and analysis
- **Content Creation Workflows** - Research → Analysis → Writing → Review
- **Complex Problem Solving** - Breaking large problems into manageable steps

## Integration with Crews

Tasks work seamlessly with Crew orchestration to create powerful workflows:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create a research and analysis workflow
research_task = Task(
    agent=Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather information"),
    description="Research market trends",
    expected_output="Market research report",
    name="research"
)

analysis_task = Task(
    agent=Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Analyze data"),
    description="Analyze market opportunities",
    expected_output="Opportunity analysis",
    context=[research_task],
    name="analysis"
)

# Execute tasks in crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task]
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Common Patterns

### Research → Analysis → Report
```python
workflow = [
    Task(agent=researcher, description="Gather data", name="research"),
    Task(agent=analyst, description="Analyze findings", context=["research"], name="analyze"),
    Task(agent=writer, description="Write report", context=["analyze"], name="report")
]
```
