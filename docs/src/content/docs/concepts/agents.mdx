description: Understanding agents - the intelligent actors in your langcrew system
---

Agents are the core building blocks of langcrew. They are autonomous AI-powered entities that can understand tasks, use tools, collaborate with humans, and work within crews to achieve complex goals.

## Quick Start - Create an Agent

Get your first agent running in just 3 lines:

```python
from langcrew import Agent

agent = Agent(role="Assistant", goal="Help users", backstory="Helpful AI")
result = agent.invoke({"messages": []})
```

## What is an Agent?

An Agent in langcrew represents a specialized AI entity with:

- **Identity**: Role, goal, and backstory that define its personality and expertise
- **Capabilities**: Tools and skills it can use to accomplish tasks
- **Intelligence**: LLM-powered reasoning and decision making
- **Collaboration**: Ability to work with other agents and humans
- **Safety**: Built-in guardrails and human oversight capabilities

## Core Architecture

Agents are built around a flexible, modular architecture:

### Design Philosophy

LangCrew agents follow three core principles:

**1. CrewAI Compatibility**
- Drop-in replacement for CrewAI agents
- Familiar role/goal/backstory pattern
- Seamless migration path

**2. Native Flexibility** 
- Custom prompts for specialized behavior
- Direct LangGraph integration
- Configurable execution strategies

**3. Production-Ready**
- Built-in safety with guardrails
- Human-in-the-loop support
- Enterprise-grade reliability

## Agent Types

### CrewAI-Style Agents

Perfect for collaborative workflows:

```python
from langcrew import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find accurate and relevant information",
    backstory="Expert researcher with academic background",
    tools=[search_tool, web_scraper]
)
```

### Native Agents

For custom behavior and specialized tasks:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage

code_reviewer = Agent(
    prompt=SystemMessage(content="You are a senior code reviewer..."),
    tools=[code_analysis_tool],
    executor_type="react"
)
```

## Core Capabilities

### Tool Integration

Agents can use any LangChain-compatible tool:

```python
from langcrew_tools.search.langchain_tools import WebSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    role="Analyst",
    tools=[WebSearchTool()]
)
```

### Memory & Context

Agents maintain conversation history and context:

```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Assistant", 
    memory=True  # Enable conversation memory
)
```

### Human Collaboration

Enable human oversight when needed:

```python
from langcrew.hitl import HITLConfig

agent = Agent(
    role="Decision Maker",
    hitl=HITLConfig(enabled=True)
)
```

### Agent Handoffs

Agents can delegate tasks to specialists:

```python
coordinator = Agent(
    role="Project Coordinator",
    handoff_to=["developer", "tester", "reviewer"]
)
```

## When to Use Agents

Agents are ideal for:

- **Autonomous Task Execution** - Tasks requiring reasoning and tool use
- **Collaborative Workflows** - Multi-agent crews working together  
- **Human-AI Collaboration** - Workflows needing human oversight
- **Specialized Expertise** - Domain-specific knowledge and skills
- **Complex Reasoning** - Multi-step problem solving
- **Tool-Rich Environments** - Applications with many available tools

## Integration with Crews

Agents work best when organized into crews for collaborative workflows:

```python
from langcrew import Agent, Crew

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather information")
writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Create content")

# Organize into a crew
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer])
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"task": "Analyze market data"})
```
