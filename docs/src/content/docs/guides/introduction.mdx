## What is LangCrew?

LangCrew is a **high-level multi-agent development framework** built on LangGraph that makes it easy to create, orchestrate, and monitor AI agent systems. It bridges the gap between research-grade multi-agent systems and production-ready applications.

## Why Choose LangCrew?

LangCrew provides three core advantages that set it apart:

- **ðŸŽ¯ Enterprise Ready**: Built-in human-in-the-loop approvals and audit trails for production environments
- **âš¡ Developer Friendly**: CrewAI-compatible decorators enable seamless migration and rapid development
- **ðŸ“Š Full-Stack Visualization**: Complete Agent-UI protocol with real-time monitoring and React components

### What You Get Out of the Box

âœ… **Decorator-Based Development** - Familiar `@agent`, `@task`, `@crew` syntax  
âœ… **YAML Configuration** - Externalize agent and task definitions  
âœ… **Tool Approval Workflows** - Human oversight for sensitive operations  
âœ… **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live execution streaming and debugging  
âœ… **Memory Management** - Persistent context across agent interactions  
âœ… **LangGraph Integration** - Native graph-based workflow orchestration  
âœ… **Production Security** - Audit trails and approval mechanisms  

## Core Features

### 1. Familiar Development Experience

Start with the decorator syntax you already know:

```python
from langcrew import CrewBase, agent, task
from langcrew_tools import WebSearchTool, WebFetchTool

@CrewBase
class MarketingCrew:
    agents_config = "config/agents.yaml"
    tasks_config = "config/tasks.yaml"
    
    @agent
    def researcher(self):
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config["researcher"],
            tools=[WebSearchTool(), WebFetchTool()]
        )
    
    @task
    def market_analysis(self):
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config["market_analysis"],
            agent=self.researcher()
        )
```

### 2. Configuration-Driven Development

Keep your logic separate from configuration:

```yaml
# config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: "Market Research Analyst"
  goal: "Gather comprehensive market intelligence"
  backstory: "Expert in identifying market trends and opportunities"

# config/tasks.yaml
market_analysis:
  description: "Analyze market trends for {product}"
  expected_output: "Detailed market analysis report with key insights"
```

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Controls

Add approval workflows where you need them:

```python
# Configure which tools require approval
hitl_config = HITLConfig(
    enabled=True,
    tools_requiring_approval=["WebSearchTool", "DatabaseTool"]
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[tasks], hitl=hitl_config)
```

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring

Stream execution events to your frontend:

```python
# Stream agent execution in real-time
async for event in crew.astream_events(input_data):
    if event["event"] == "on_tool_start":
        print(f"Tool: {event['name']} started")
    elif event["event"] == "on_agent_finish":
        print(f"Agent completed: {event['data']['output']}")
```

## Migration from CrewAI

LangCrew provides **seamless migration** from existing CrewAI projects:

1. âœ… **Same Decorator Syntax** - Your `@agent`, `@task`, `@crew` decorators work unchanged
2. âœ… **Configuration Compatibility** - Existing YAML configs work out of the box
3. âœ… **Enhanced Capabilities** - Gain HITL, monitoring, and production features automatically
