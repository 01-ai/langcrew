---

This guide will walk you through installing langcrew and setting up your development environment.

## Requirements

Before installing langcrew, ensure you have:

- **Python**: 3.11 to 3.12
- **pip**: Latest version recommended
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for project isolation

## Installation

> **Note**: langcrew is currently not open source and requires access to a private package index.

Install langcrew directly using uv with the private index:

```bash
uv add langcrew --prerelease=allow --index https://nexus.lingyiwanwu.net/repository/pypi-hosted/simple
```

### Optional: Configure Private Index Permanently

If you plan to use langcrew frequently, you can configure the private index in your `pyproject.toml` to avoid specifying it each time:

```toml
[tool.uv]
default-groups = ['dev']
extra-index-url = ["https://nexus.lingyiwanwu.net/repository/pypi-hosted/simple"]
```

After adding this configuration, you can simply run:

```bash
uv add langcrew --prerelease=allow
```

### Development Installation

To contribute or modify langcrew, you'll need to clone the repository and set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/01-ai/langcrew.git
cd langcrew
```

The repository includes the necessary private index configuration in its `pyproject.toml`. Install the development dependencies using uv:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip with the private index
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://nexus.lingyiwanwu.net/repository/pypi-hosted/simple
```

## Verify Installation

```python
import langcrew
print(langcrew.__version__)

# Test basic functionality
from langcrew import Agent

agent = Agent(
    role="Test Agent",
    goal="Verify installation",
    backstory="A helpful test agent"
)
print(f"Agent created: {agent.role}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'langcrew'**

- Ensure you've activated your virtual environment
