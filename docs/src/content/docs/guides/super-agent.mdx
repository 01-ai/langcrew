Super Agent is a powerful intelligent agent system built on the LangCrew framework, integrating browser automation, web search, code execution, file operations, and various other tools. It provides complete Web API services with streaming response support.

## Prerequisites and Configuration

## Environment Variables

Before using Super Agent, you need to configure environment variables.

**Important Note**: Please refer to the environment variable configuration example file in the project:
- **Configuration Example File**: [`examples/components/web/super_agent/.env.example`](https://github.com/01-ai/langcrew/blob/main/examples/components/web/super_agent/.env.example)

**Please configure all the following environment variables to ensure Super Agent runs properly**:

```bash

  - `AGENTBOX_TEMPLATE`: Cloud phone template

**Important Note**: `E2B_TEMPLATE` and `E2B_DOMAIN` must use the specified values above. These are dedicated sandbox environment configurations provided by 01 for the current demo. Please do not modify them.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Navigate to the Example Project Directory

```bash
cd examples/components/web/super_agent
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the current directory:

```bash
# Copy configuration example file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file to fill in necessary configurations
```

### Step 3: Start Services

```bash
docker-compose -f compose-super-agent.yaml up --build
```

### Step 3: Access Services

After startup is complete, you can access:
- **Super Agent API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend Web UI**: http://localhost:3600

* Note: The front-end service requires 5-6 minutes to start up.

### Docker Compose Architecture Overview

The `compose-super-agent.yaml` file in the example directory defines the complete full-stack architecture:

**frontend service**:
- Based on Node.js 18 Alpine image
- Port mapping: 3600:3600
- Automatically installs dependencies and starts development server
- Environment variable: `AGENT_API_HOST=http://super-agent:8000`
- Mounts `./web` directory as frontend code

**super-agent service**:
- Built based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory
- Port mapping: 8000:8000
- Loads environment variables from `.env` file
- Run mode: full, log level: info
- Network: langcrew-network (for communication with frontend service)

## Integration with LangCrew Framework

Super Agent is built entirely on the LangCrew framework, showcasing the framework's powerful capabilities:

- **Decorator Development Pattern**: Uses `@agent`, `@crew` decorators
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Integrates LangCrew-Tools toolset
- **Streaming Monitoring**: Real-time execution status and result streams
- **Session Management**: Persistent context and state
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Built-in approval and interaction mechanisms

Super Agent is a perfect demonstration of the LangCrew framework's capabilities, providing a complete reference implementation for building production-grade intelligent agent systems.
