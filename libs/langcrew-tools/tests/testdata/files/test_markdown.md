# LangCrew

LangCrew is a high-level multi-agent development framework built on LangGraph, offering out-of-the-box core capabilities to help construct complex agent collaboration systems:

1. **Beyond Traditional Flexible Paradigms**: Provides a simple, highly configurable development experience, featuring powerful built-in mechanisms such as HITL (Human-in-the-Loop), dynamic workflow orchestration, and event-driven processes—empowering stronger agent collaboration.

2. **Full-Stack Support for Productization**: Comes with an accompanying Agent-UI protocol and React component library, enabling the frontend to clearly visualize agent planning, scheduling, execution processes, and tool invocation details. This significantly accelerates the journey from agent development to productization, allowing for rapid delivery to users.

3. **Application Templates for Fast Launch**: Offers a rich variety of ready-to-use templates, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of multi-agent solutions across a wide range of industries and scenarios.

4. **Integrated Development and Operations Support**: Integrates free SaaS services, seamlessly covering system construction, deep observability, sandbox environments, and deployment resources—simplifying the entire lifecycle from development to operations.
